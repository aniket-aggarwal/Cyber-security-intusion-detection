# Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## Project Overview

With the exponential growth of computer networks and the increasing number of applications running on them, network security has become a critical concern. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) play a crucial role in detecting anomalies and attacks in the network to safeguard against potential threats. This project aims to build a Network Intrusion Detection System capable of detecting both anomalies and specific attack types using binomial and multinomial classification techniques.

## Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop an efficient Network Intrusion Detection System that can accurately identify anomalies and classify various types of attacks. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the system will be able to predict whether an activity is normal or an attack, and further classify the specific attack type.

## Problems to Solve

1. Binomial Classification:
   - Detect anomalies by predicting whether an activity is normal or an attack.

2. Multinomial Classification:
   - Detect specific types of activities by predicting whether an activity is normal, back, buffer overflow, FTP write, guess password, Neptune, N-Map, port sweep, root kit, Satan, or Smurf.

## Data Description

The organization has collected data over time for different types of attacks, along with normal network activity. The data is provided in 10 different tables, each corresponding to a specific type of attack.

The tables are as follows:
- Data_of_Attack_Back_Normal
- Data_of_Attack_Back
- Data_of_Attack_Back_BufferOverflow
- Data_of_Attack_Back_FTPWrite
- Data_of_Attack_Back_GuessPassword
- Data_of_Attack_Back_Neptune
- Data_of_Attack_Back_NMap
- Data_of_Attack_Back_PortSweep
- Data_of_Attack_Back_Rootkit
- Data_of_Attack_Back_Satan
- Data_of_Attack_Back_Smurf


## Conclusion

The Network Intrusion Detection System developed in this project aims to enhance network security by detecting anomalies and specific attack types. The models' accuracy and effectiveness will contribute to the organization's ability to respond proactively to potential threats, ensuring a safer and more secure network environment.
